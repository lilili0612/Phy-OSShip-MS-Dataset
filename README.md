## 📖 Introduction

**Phy-OSShip-MS** is a novel dataset designed for [briefly describe the purpose, e.g., marine ship style transfer / object detection]. This dataset accompanies our proposed **Physics-Guided Style Transfer** method, which integrates physical constraints into the generation process to ensure [mention the benefit, e.g., structural realism / texture consistency].

### Dataset Features
* **Domain:** [e.g., Maritime / Remote Sensing / Simulation]
* **Scale:** [e.g., Contains 10,000+ images in the full version]
* **Physics Guidance:** [Briefly mention the physics aspect]
